Inside the mountain, she met Old Rinkrank, a wizard. He made her work for him as his servant. Every day, he would magically bring out a ladder from his pocket, climb up the mountain, and then pull the ladder back up with him. When he returned, he would bring gold and silver with him. One day, the princess had an idea. She closed all the doors and windows of the cave, leaving only a tiny window open. When Rinkrank returned, she refused to open the door.

Come back tomorrow, and we'll find out!" The next day, the boastful man set out on his way. On his journey, he came across a lovely shoe lying on the path. However, he didn't stop to pick it up. Little did he know, his challenger was hiding nearby. After the bragging man passed by, the challenger picked up the shoe, took a shortcut, and reached a spot ahead of the braggart. He cleverly placed the shoe back on the path and waited. When the boastful man came along, he was surprised to see another shoe that looked just like the one he saw earlier. Confused, he realized he should have picked up the first shoe. So, he decided to go back, leaving his sled and deer tied to a tree. As he retraced his steps, the challenger picked up both shoes and the sled. Poof! He vanished from the spot. The bragging man returned, only to find his sled missing! He figured out what had happened and followed the footprints of his deer to the challenger's house. There, he admitted his defeat and went home without his sled, as a reminder not to boast too much. Moral: it's better to be humble than to brag, or you might end up losing something important.
