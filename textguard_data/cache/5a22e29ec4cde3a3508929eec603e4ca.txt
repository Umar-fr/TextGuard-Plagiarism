C# is an object-oriented programming language and classes and objects are the fundamental components of OOP’s . Everything in C# is built upon classes and objects. Let us learn classes and objects with an example. C# Class A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype for creating Objects. We can say that it is a template for creating objects for a class. A class can have fields, methods, constructors, etc and these members can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class that is an object. Example for defining a class with few fields and methods in C#. public class Rectangle { //field int length , breadth ; int area ; // method public void area ( ) { area = length * breadth ; } } The definition of the class starts with the keyword class followed by a class name . The body of the class is enclosed within the curly brace. All the members of the class are declared within the body of the class as shown above. C# Object Objects are real-world entities. Example bike, Lamp, pen, table, etc. It is an instance of a class that has states and behavior. It can be physical and logical. The Class members are accessed by creating an object of that class and is a runtime entity created at runtime. To create an object of a class we use the keyword new . //creating an object of class Rectangle Rectangle rect = new Rectangle ( ) ; In the above code, Rectangle is a type and rect is a reference variable that refers to the instance of the Rectangle class. And the new keyword allocates the memory at runtime in a program. Example1: C# Class and Object Let see an example where we create a class Rectangle and have a method calculate the area and also display the area value. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 using System ; public class Rectangle { //field int length = 2 , breadth = 3 ; int area ; // method public void areaFunc ( ) { area = length * breadth ; Console . WriteLine ( "Area: {0}" , area ) ; } public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { Rectangle rect = new Rectangle ( ) ; //object rect . areaFunc ( ) ; } } Output: Area: 6 Example1: C# Class and Object In the example below, we will put the main method at the different classes and create multiple objects for the Student class. Also, display the student information. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 using System ; public class Student { //field int roll = 2 ; String name ; //Constructor public Student ( int r , String str ) { this . roll = r ; this . name = str ; } // method public void display ( ) { Console . WriteLine ( "Roll: {0}, Name: {1}" , roll , name ) ; } } class StudentInfo { public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { Student std1 = new Student ( 1 , "John Mac" ) ; //object Student std2 = new Student ( 2 , "Ryan Blanc" ) ; //object std1 . display ( ) ; std2 . display ( ) ; } } Output: Roll: 1, Name: John Mac Roll: 2, Name: Ryan Blanc Also, a constructor is included in order to initialize the class field. in this tutorial, we will write a java program to find the sum of the Largest Forward Diagonal in an Arraylist (matrix). Java Program to … A separate function( search_function()) will be created where the array pointer will be declared and the searched element along with the size of an array … This C program calculates the sum of digits of a given number using recursion. Here’s a concise explanation: Function Definition: sumDigits(int n) This function calculates … Recursion refers to the function calling itself directly or in a cycle. Before we begin, you should have the knowledge of following in C Programming: … The program takes the two numbers from the user and passes the reference to the function where the sum is calculated. You may go through … In this tutorial, we will write a program to find a pairs of elements from an array such that for the input [a,b,c,d,e,f,g] we will …
