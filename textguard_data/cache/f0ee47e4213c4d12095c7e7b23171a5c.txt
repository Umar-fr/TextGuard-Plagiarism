SomeClass::class will return the fully qualified name of SomeClass including the namespace. This feature was implemented in PHP 5.5. Documentation: http://php.net/manual/en/migration55.new-features.php#migration55.new-features.class-name It's very useful for 2 reasons. You don't have to store your class names in strings anymore. So, many IDEs can retrieve these class names when you refactor your code You can use the use keyword to resolve your class and you don't need to write the full class name. For example : use \App\Console\Commands\Inspire; //... protected $commands = [ Inspire::class, // Equivalent to "App\Console\Commands\Inspire" ]; Update : This feature is also useful for Late Static Binding . Instead of using the __CLASS__ magic constant, you can use the static::class feature to get the name of the derived class inside the parent class. For example: class A { public function getClassName(){ return __CLASS__; } public function getRealClassName() { return static::class; } } class B extends A {} $a = new A; $b = new B; echo $a->getClassName(); // A echo $a->getRealClassName(); // A echo $b->getClassName(); // A echo $b->getRealClassName(); // B
