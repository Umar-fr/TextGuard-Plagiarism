I will try to give more technical explanation rather than an abstract one. I think that definitions like "a class is a blueprint and an object is something made from this blueprint" are impossible to understand for newbies simply because these kind of definitions are abstract and context-less. Classes and objects have a pure abstract meaning in the object oriented world but for simplicity I will reduce the definition to a more practical one. Consider the following statement: int a; "int" is a type and is "a" is a variable which has the type "int". C++ provides various ways to let the programmer define new types; for example: typedef int* int_ptr; int_ptr a; In this example , a new type is defined int_ptr. "int_ptr" is a type , "a" is a variable which has the type "int_ptr". Another example: struct Point { int x; int y; }; Point a; Here, a new type is defined , "Point", and "a" is a variable which has the type "Point". So what is a class in C++? A class is another way to define a new type, just like the other ways mentioned above. What is an object? An object is a variable which has a type that was defined using the class keyword. For example: class SmartPoint { public: Point(x,y); Move(x,y); protected: int x,y ; }; SmartPoint a; In this example, a new type is defined , "SmartPoint", and "a" is a variable which has the type "SmartPoint". You may ask then what is different between a type defined by using the "class" keyword or "struct" keyword or "typedef" — but that is a matter for another discussion.
