The moment of impact is the moment when something hit something else (perhaps a car accident). The speaker cannot remember that moment (they have no memory of it). Because no (not any) comes before memory , there is no need for the definite article the. If the person did remember something, they might say "The memory of the impact will stay with me for a long time." A king of fighters could mean an especially good fighter (one who is special among fighters in general). A king of the fighters might be the leader of a particular group of fighters.
