We first present a taxonomy of the state, action, reward, and algorithm used in the surveyed papers, to provide a unified view of the literature in Table 1 and 2 in Appendix A . We organize the state, action and reward variables into several categories: (1) The state variables include the price information (historical prices, returns, change of price, etc.), inventory information (the on-hand units for one stock or every stock in the portfolio), technical indicators (Relative Strength Index, Moving Average Convergence Divergence, etc., denoted as “tech-indicators in Table 1 ”), market indicators (Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, etc.), company information (P/E ratio, dividend, market capitalization, etc.), predictive representations of state, trading volume (including volume of past trades, change of volume, market share of different agents, etc.), bid-ask information (bid-ask spread, imbalance of bid-ask order in the limit order book, etc.), volatility, time index, and end-to-end information (E2E, where we directly use a large number of observable variables). (2) The action variables are summarized as long/short/hold, the target portfolio weight, the bid price, and the trading quantity. (3) The reward variables are summarized as slippage, implementation shortfall (IS), PnL (including cash income and outflow, and some other customized function of profit), return, volatility-adjusted return (VR, which includes the Sharp ratio and other variants), inventory penalty, market quality (containing bid-ask spread, some measures of price change, etc, as discussed in Chan & Shelton ( 2001 ) ), and various shaped rewards. Here, a shaped reward (Lin & Beling, 2020a , b ) refers to a reward definition that is not the same as any existing metrics but instead has a relatively complicated (but carefully designed) structure to achieve a special goal.
