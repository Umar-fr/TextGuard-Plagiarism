A preposition phrase headed by of is a common way of attributing a quality to a noun, either as a modifier or as a predicate: a man of discretion = a man who ‘possesses’ discretion, “a discreet man”. This approach is of value . = This approach ‘possesses’ value, “it is valuable”. This construction pushes the attributed quality to the end of the phrase or clause, the emphatic position where ‘new information’ usually appears. The construction is particularly useful with a modified oblique—that is, of ADJ NOUN —where the alternative ADV + ADJ would be awkward: This is a problem of challenging difficulty vs This is a ? challengingly difficult problem.
