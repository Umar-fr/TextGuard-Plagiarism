User Defined Data Types in C++ Last Updated : 11 Jul, 2025 User defined data types are those data types that are defined by the user himself. In C++, these data types allow programmers to extend the basic data types provided and create new types that are more suited to their specific needs. C++ supports 5 user-defined data types: Let's take a look at each of them one by one. 1. Class A Class is the building block of C++'s Object-Oriented programming paradigm. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. Example C++ #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std ; class GfG { // Access specifier public : // Data Member string name ; // Member Function void printname () { cout << name ; } }; int main () { // Declare an object of class geeks GfG g ; // Accessing data member g . name = "GeeksForGeeks" ; // Accessing member function g . printname (); return 0 ; } Explanation: The above program defines a class named GfG with a name attribute and a function printname () to print the name. In the main function, it creates an object named g , sets the geekname as " GeeksforGeeks ", and calls the printname () function to display it. 2. Structure A Structure is a user-defined data type like class. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. Example C++ #include <iostream> using namespace std ; // Declaring structure struct A { int i ; char c ; }; int main () { // Create an instance of structure A a ; // Initialize structure members a . i = 65 ; a . c = 'A' ; cout << a . c << ": " << a . i ; return 0 ; } Explanation: The above demonstrates program demonstrates the use of structures by defining a structure named A having i and c members. It then creates an instance if structure in the main function, sets the members' values, and prints them. Structures in C++ are different from structures in C and resembles classes.

Union Like structures , union is also user-defined data type used to group data of different type into a single type. But in union, all members share the same memory location. Example C++ #include <iostream> using namespace std ; // Declaration of union is same as the structures union A { int i ; char c ; }; int main () { // A union variable t A a ; // Assigning value to c, i will also // assigned the same a . c = 'A' ; cout << "a.i: " << a . i << endl ; cout << "a.c: " << a . c ; return 0 ; } Explanation: The above program demonstrates the use of unions. Union named A with members i and c is defined that shares the same memory space. It is shown that when we only assign c some value, the i also stores the same value. 4. Enumeration Enumeration (or enum) is a user-defined data type in C++ mainly used to assign names to integral constants, the names make a program easy to read and maintain. Example C++ #include <iostream> using namespace std ; // Declaring enum enum Week { Mon , Tue , Wed , Thur , Fri , Sat , Sun }; int main () { // Creating enum variable enum Week day ; // Assigning value to the variabe day = Wed ; cout << day ; return 0 ; } 5. Typedef and Using C++ allows you to define explicitly new data type names by using the keywords typedef or using . They do not create a new data class, rather, defines a name for an existing type. This can increase the portability (the ability of a program to be used across different types of machines; i.e., mini, mainframe, micro, etc; without many changes to the code) of a program as only the typedef statements would have to be changed. Example C++ #include <iostream> using namespace std ; // Using typedef to define a new name for existing type typedef float f ; // Using 'using' to define a new name for existing type using integer = int ; int main () { // Declaring variables using new type names f x = 3.14 ; integer y = 42 ; cout << "Float Value: " << x << endl ; cout << "Integer Value: " << y ; return 0 ; } Output Float Value: 3.14 Integer Value: 42
