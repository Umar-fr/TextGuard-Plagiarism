This <?> is a beast. It often leads to confusion and errors, because, when you see it first, then you start believing, <?> is a wildcard for any java type . Which is .. not true. <?> is the unknown type , a slight and nasty difference. It's not a problem when you use it with Class . Both lines work and compile: Class anyType = String.class; Class <?> theUnknownType = String.class; But - if we start using it with collections, then we see strange compiletime errors: List<?> list = new ArrayList<Object>(); // ArrayList<?> is not allowed list.add("a String"); // doesn't compile ... Our List<?> is not a collection, that is suitable for just any type of object. It can only store one type: the mystic "unkown type". Which is not a real type, for sure.
