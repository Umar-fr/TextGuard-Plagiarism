I was looking around online for a solution to what seems like should be a relatively straightforward, solvable problem. Classes like SampleClass are objects of type, which you can confirm by calling type() with the class object as an argument or by accessing the .__class__ attribute.. Notice that importing from time and defining process_data() produce no output. This code pattern is quite common in Python files that you want to be executed as a script and imported in another module. +1 This is awesome, but there's no reference to it in the python docs at the URL you provided. That's a very elegant design, methods are just plain functions in the class'. This is all pretty misleading. Some points on Python class: Classes are created by keyword class. What if the numbers and words I wrote on my check don't match? It also helps to break the large group of code into smaller chunks or modules. To learn more, see our tips on writing great answers.

All functions, classes, and callable objects have a __call__ method: Though using the built-in callable function is a better way to check for callability: The callable built-in function returns True if the given argument is a callable and False otherwise. All three of these lines involve callables: We don't know what something, AnotherThing, and something_else do: but we know they're callables. ''' x=parent.sum(self,a,b) print("sum=",x) Complete code in a single window: Python program to call a method from another class #create parent class whose method is called by your class class parent: def sum(self,a,b): return a+b class your_class: Another common practice in Python is to have main() execute other functions, rather than including the task-accomplishing code in main(). __name__ has the value 'execution_methods', which is the name of the .py file that Python is importing from.

All functions are also descriptors, so you can bind them by calling their __get__ method: Here's R. Hettinger's excellent guide to descriptors. So basically I want to define the function in one step (def plus_2_times_4) and use the function when defining a method in another step (def arithmetic). And that really does seem like what you want here. Remember that, in Python, there is no difference between strings defined with single quotes (') and double quotes ("). So this should be changed to types.MethodType(f, C()). Find centralized, trusted content and collaborate around the technologies you use most.
